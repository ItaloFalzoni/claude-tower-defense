    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The game has an economy based on Claude Coins. You earn coins by defeating enemies during the waves. Coins
          are required to buy new towers and upgrade them.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>To buy a new tower, click the Buy button and choose an available spot on the map. An indicator will guide you
          to valid placement locations.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>When you click on a tower, you have two options: sell it or upgrade it. Each tower can be upgraded up to two
          levels, requiring more coins.</p>
      </li>
