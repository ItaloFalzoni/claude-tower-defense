    <h1>About Claude Tower Defense</h1>

    <p>
      Claude Tower Defense is a lightweight, browser-based tower defense game designed as an open-source experiment in
      building playable 2D games using standard web technologies. The primary goal was to create an approachable,
      responsive gameplay loop that runs in modern browsers without installations or plugins — so anyone can load the
      page and start playing in seconds.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game focuses on clear, tactical decisions: players place towers along enemy paths, balance economy and
      upgrades, and react to escalating waves of enemies. Each tower type has distinct strengths and tradeoffs
      (rate-of-fire, range, damage), and players must adapt their strategy as the waves change. The interface was
      designed to be minimal and fast, prioritizing framerate and predictable behavior over heavy visuals.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project is intentionally small and modular — the codebase is a compact set of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files
      so collaborators can quickly inspect and modify mechanics. The codebase is open for experimentation: you can tweak
      tower stats, add new enemy types, or wire up a leaderboard. Contributions are welcome; see the repository for
      issues and pull requests.
    </p>

    <h2>Open Source & development</h2>
    <p>
      This project is fully open source on GitHub (ItaloFalzoni/claude-tower-defense). The repo contains the site HTML,
      gameplay scripts and basic assets so developers can fork and extend the game. If you’re a developer, look at js/
      (game logic), styles/ (layout) and assets/ (icons, sprites) to get started.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Compatibility & support
    </h2>
    <p>
      Recommended: desktop Chrome or Firefox for best performance. Mobile is supported but performance varies by device.
      If you spot bugs or want to request features, open an issue on <a
        href="https://github.com/ItaloFalzoni/Claude-Tower-Defense">Github</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond being a small playable game, Claude Tower Defense is intended as a learning resource — a concrete example
      of how to architect simple game systems with web technologies. Use it as a base for experimentation, education, or
      as a quick demo for web game ideas.
